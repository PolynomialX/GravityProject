Personal project:

Initial Scope:
1. Simulate the dynamics of two particles, influenced only by gravity.
2. First milestone will be output of the two positions in vector format on the terminal





Possible Extensions:
1. Simulate N-body interactions - let the user decide positions and initial conditions.
2. Output their positions via a GUI - allow for user's to grab onto particles etc.


Initial Ideas for exploring themes:
1. Optimisation - we could trial some SIMD operations
2. Using threads to look after particles or groups of particles
3.
